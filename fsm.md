# Playback FSM

Audiovisual playback is asynchronous, a combination of IO and user events. Playback synchronizes these events and handles them serially implementing a finite-state machine with five states.

- inactive
- paused
- preparing
- listening
- viewing

Here are the states and their transitions in detail. Unhandled events trap.

## inactive

A Playback session starts **inactive** with an unconfigured, inactive `AVAudioSession`, waiting for `.change(Entry?)` to start, trapping all all other events, except `.resume`, which turns on `Resuming`, so the next `.change(Entry?)` will start playing.

Being **inactive** may be unintended, so this state optionally stores an error, the cause of inactivity.

### Events

```swift
.change(let entry)
```

The `.change(Entry?)` event with an entry activates the session and transits to the **paused** state, while `.change` without entry deactivates the session remaining in **inactive** state.

## paused

In **paused** we have an item and finished a setup cycle, leaving us either ready to play or with an error.

### Events

```swift
.change(Entry?)
```

In **paused** state the current entry can be changed or set to `nil` deactivating the sessionâ€”leaving us in **paused** or transfering to **inactive**.

```swift
.toggle | .resume
```

Plays the current item, eventually, after transfering to **preparing**, which will trigger `ready` or `error` events.

```swift
.playing
```

Tansfers to `.listening(Entry)` or `viewing(Entry, AVPlayer`). If our internal player is not in the required state, this will trap.

```swift
.ready
```

After `ready` in **paused** state, we seek the player to the previous play time of this item and pause, leaving us in **paused**, but seeked to the correct position, ready to play.

```swift
.error(PlaybackError)
```

If an `error` occures during **paused**, it will be added to the **paused** state, in which we remain.

```swift
.paused | .video | .pause
```

These events are handled but ignored, leaving us **paused**.

## preparing

Preparing is a transitional state, handling most events.

### Events

```swift
.error(PlaybackError)
```

```swift
.resume
```

Continue **preparing** but will resume once we are **ready**.

```swift
.pause
```

Pauses the player changing to **paused**.

```swift
.toggle
```

Keep **preparing** but toggle automatic resuming.

```swift
.ready
```

```swift
.change(Entry)
```

```swift
.playing
```

```swift
.playing
```

```swift
.video | .scrub
```

These events are ignored without trapping, we continue in **preparing**.

## listening/viewing

Listening and viewing are logically incorporated into a single state, just marking the difference between audio and video playback.
